# Introduction

### Accessing Device Data with SecuReporter Open API Service 

SecuReporter supports an interface for software to directly interact with the SecuReporter cloud platform. These APIs empower SecuReporter users to retrieve device logs from the past 31 days using an API token.  

With the `SecuReporter Open API`, you can easily access your device data through HTTP requests using any programming language or cURL commands. To utilize this service, __ensure that your device has a valid SecuReporter license and an Open API Token__. These credentials are necessary to authenticate and authorize your requests to the API.

# Requirements
### SecurReporter License
Your device requires a valid SecuReporter license. If your license has expired, please contact the device's owner. Purchase the license from [Zyxel marketplace](https://marketplace.zyxel.com/) to access `Open API Service`.

### Open API Token
The `Open API Service` is authorized using `Open API Token` generated by the `agent role` on the SecurReporter portal.

__Your `Open API Token` is a secret!__ Users access the device data with `Open API Token` and do not require MZC account. Never share it with unrelated parties. Ensure that production requests are routed exclusively through your own backend server where your `Open API Token` can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.
 
If you haven't generated `Open API Token` yet, you can get [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.
If you obtain the `Open API Token`, proceed to the [Setup API Token and Make Your First Open API Call](#add-open-api-token-to-environment-variable-recommended) sections.

# Authentication
### Request Header
Every HTTP request must have an `Open API Token` in the `X-Authorization` header and specify the `Content-Type` in the header as follows:

```bash
X-Authorization: Bearer $OPEN_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

# Open API Service
The current available `Open API Service` is as follows, and each service has corresponding `quota usage limits`. For details, please refer to each service.

  </summary>


### Setup Python
To check if you have Python installed, open your Command Prompt or Terminal. Enter the word `python` and then press return/enter. If you receive an error stating that python is not found, you can install it by following the instructions available on the [official python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To use the `Requests` library, you need at least `Python 3.8 or newer`.

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Create a project directory and create a virtual environment. You can follow [official python venv document](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create your virtual environment.

Activate the Virtual Environment after creating the virtual environment.

<details>
 <summary>macOS</summary>

  ```bash
  source your-virtual-environment-path/bin/activate
  ```

### Update Pip Library and Install the Requests Library
update `pip` to the latest version.
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade requests
```

### Confirm the Requests Library Installed
If you install `requests` library success, it display the requests library version.

```bash
pip list | grep requests
```

### Make Your First Open API Request
The first `Open API` request should be to download the Zyxel Deviceâ€™s archived logs from SecuReporter using the Python request library. Then, create a file named test.py using the Terminal or Command line or an IDE.

1. Replace the following information:
  - Replace `yyyy-MM-dd` with a date within the past 31 days (excluding the current date) using the yyyy-mm-dd format.
  - Replace `mydir` with the path to the download folder on your computer.
2. Copy and paste one of the examples below into `test.py`.

    ```python
    import os
    import requests

    # Open API endpoint
    open_api_url = "https://secureporter.cloudcnm.zyxel.com/open-api/v1/archive-logs/download"
    open_api_token = os.getenv('OPEN_API_TOKEN')
    # Save tar file path
    # Replace "mydir" with your actual download folder path
    tar_file_path = 'mydir/archive.tar'

    # Define the headers and payload
    headers = {
        "X-Authorization": f"Bearer {open_api_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    # Replace "yyyy-MM-dd" with a single day within the past 31 days (excluding the current day)
    payload = {
        "device_date":"yyyy-MM-dd"
    }
    # Make the POST request
    response = requests.post(open_api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    content = response.content
    # Check the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        content_type = response.headers['Content-Type']

        if content_type == 'application/x-tar':
            with open(tar_file_path, 'wb') as tar_file:
                tar_file.write(content)
            print("Request successed!")
            print("Download Tar File Path:", tar_file_path)
        else:
            print("Request failed!")
            print("Response:", content)
    else:
        print("Request failed!")
        print("Status code:", response.status_code)
        print("Response:", content)
    ```
3. Run the Python script using your IDE, or via the command line 

    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```
    ##### Handling Extraction Errors
    If you encounter an error message while download the archive logs, you can inspect error code for more details, and refer to the [Error Code](#error-code) section.

4. After executing the sample code, download device's archive log to your folder.

### Deprecation
As we enhance and improve the `Open API` user experience, we may periodically release updates and enhancements to the `Open API`. These updates may eventually lead to end-of-life (EOL) for older version. To keep users informed, we will announce such changes on our official website. Additionally, in the response headers of older `Open API` versions, you will find supplementary information under the Deprecation and Sunset parameters. These parameters indicate the date and time when the API version is deprecated and when it will be sunsetted, respectively. If you encounter these parameters in the response headers, it is advisable to prepare for an update to a newer version of the `Open API` to ensure uninterrupted service.

An about to be deprecated verisonversion response must will specify the `Deprecation` and `Sunset` in the header as follows:

```bash
Deprecation: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ
Sunset: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ
```
